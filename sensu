Bamboos are a diverse group of mostly evergreen perennial flowering plants making up the subfamily Bambusoideae of the grass family Poaceae. Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family, in the case of Dendrocalamus sinicus individual culms reaching a length of 151 feet (46 meters), up to fourteen inches (36 centimeters) in thickness and a weight of up to 990 pounds (450 kilograms).[3] The internodes of bamboos can also be of great length. Kinabaluchloa wrayi has internodes up to 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) in length.[4] exceeded in length only by Papyrus. By contrast, the culms of the tiny bamboo Raddiella vanessiae of the Kaieteur Plateau in French Guiana are only 0.4–0.8 inches (10–20 millimeters) in length by about one-twelfth inch (two millimeters) in width.[5][6] The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it probably comes from the Dutch or Portuguese language, which originally borrowed it from Malay or Kannada.[7]
